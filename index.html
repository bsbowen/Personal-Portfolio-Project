        <p>  <b> Welcome to my portfolio!<b></b> I am currently embarking on an exciting journey in a full stack development
                 apprenticeship program, seeking to merge new technical skills with my background in HR. 
                 While I'm still exploring various aspects of web development, I have found a particular 
                 interest in front-end design, enjoying the creative process of making websites visually 
                 appealing.</br>

             <br> One of my favorite projects so far has been creating templates in Figmaâ€”despite
                  the initial challenges, it was rewarding to see the final design come together.</br>

             <br> Outside of coding, I love spending time at the beach, especially flying kites and
                  enjoying family time with my two-year-old niece. When I need to unwind,
                  I indulge in relaxation days with massages and facials, or take peaceful evening walks.</br>

              <br> As I continue to learn and grow, I aim to refine my skills in HTML and CSS to create seamless, stylish web experiences. 
                   Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to sharing more of my work and progress with you!</br>
